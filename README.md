# SandwichGuyNPC
A simple mod that adds an NPC named Sandwich Guy. As his name suggests, he sells sandwiches. Some regular and some weird. The sandwiches give varying stat and effect bonuses. He can spawn after defeating the Eye of Cthulhu, and starting then will sell an additional sandwich for every (vanilla) boss defeated. Sandwich Guy also sells unique sandwiches depending on other tModLoader mods you have installed. If you don't want to download those mods, you can still get the unique sandwiches through the Sandwich Bag, wich is sold once the world is set to hard mode.
